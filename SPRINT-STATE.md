# Sprint State

- Project: Rashtra: Sovereign Republic (Desktop Remake)
- Status: Phase 02 completed; Ready for Phase 03.
- Active phase: 02 (World Map, Country Selection & Scenario Start) -> COMPLETED
- Active sprint: 02-03 (New game setup and initial world state) -> COMPLETED; Next: 03-01 (Deterministic time step, tick loop, and month rollover)
- Sprint status: Completed (All 3 Phase 02 sprints completed: Country registry, World Map vector geometry & interaction, Repeatable scenario start; 70/70 tests green)
- Last verified commit: Phase 02 completion
- Last CI run: Local `.\build.ps1` execution passed (70/70 tests pass, ContentValidator verified 6 countries, 1 scenario, 1 map dataset, 0 warnings/errors)

## Current objective
Transition to Phase 03 (Turn Advancement, Calendar & National Indicators) and execute Sprint 03-01 (Deterministic time step, tick loop, and month rollover).

## Blockers / decisions
- Reference Game Access Limitation: Direct Android APK execution is not supported natively in this Windows agent environment without an emulator. Publicly verified developer documentation, store descriptions, and gameplay captures were synthesized into `REFERENCE-INVENTORY.md` and `FEATURE-PARITY-MATRIX.md`. A companion checklist (`docs/research/REFERENCE-RESEARCH-CHECKLIST.md`) is provided for the human owner to log live-session numerical coefficients.
- Technical Spike & Toolchain (ADR-003): .NET 8 LTS + pure domain solution + automated CI verified across Windows and Ubuntu.
- UI Design System & Navigation (Phase 01): Completed (`NavigationService`, `UserSettings`, `SettingsService`, and UI wireframes).
- Country Registry Data (Sprint 02-01): Completed (`CountryRegistry`, `CountryDefinition`, and 6 data-driven country definitions: `IND`, `USA`, `CHN`, `RUS`, `GBR`, `PAK`).
- World Map & Selection (Sprint 02-02): Completed (`MapGeometry`, `MapProjection`, `GeoJsonMapLoader`, `CountrySelectionViewModel`, Natural Earth Public Domain dataset).
- Scenario Start & Initial State (Sprint 02-03): Completed (`ScenarioDefinition`, `NewGameConfig`, `GameInitializer`, `NewGameSetupViewModel`, `CountrySelect.tscn`).
- Map Data Licensing (ADR-002): Natural Earth Admin 0 Public Domain vector datasets integrated under `GEO-01`.
- Branding & Clean-Room Policy: Resolved in Sprint 00-02 via `docs/legal/CLEAN-ROOM-POLICY.md` (Working title: "Rashtra: Sovereign Republic").

## Update protocol
Record actual commands, test outcomes, screenshots/reports, commit/PR, unresolved issues and next action. Do not mark a sprint done unless acceptance criteria pass.
